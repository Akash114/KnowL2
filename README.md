# L2 Resource Usage Monitoring Tool

The L2 Resource Usage Monitoring Tool is a project aimed at providing insights into resource consumption on Layer 2 (L2) blockchain networks, with a focus on the Optimism ecosystem. The tool aims to visualize gas usage, transaction volume, storage consumption, and other key metrics in real time, helping developers, users, and network operators optimize their interactions and contribute to network health.

## Project Overview

As Optimism and other Layer 2 solutions gain traction, it becomes increasingly important to monitor and understand the resource consumption on these chains. This project seeks to create a comprehensive monitoring tool that offers insights into resource usage patterns on the Optimism Mainnet. The tool will empower users with valuable information to make informed decisions, optimize their transactions, and encourage efficient coding practices within the ecosystem.

## Features

- Real-time Resource Visualization: Display gas usage, transaction volume, storage consumption, and other resource metrics in real time through interactive charts and graphs.

- Transaction Analysis: Provide detailed statistics on individual transactions, including sender and receiver addresses, gas used, and transaction type.

- Gas Fee Estimation: Offer users an estimate of gas fees based on historical data to help them plan and prioritize transactions.

- Withdrawal Tracking: Monitor withdrawal activities from the network, highlighting patterns and trends.

- Customizable Filters: Allow users to filter and analyze data based on various parameters such as time, contract, transaction type, and more.


## App Setup

1. Clone the repository.
